Data Journal and Notes:

After doing some basic analysis of the data primarily looking at the percentage change of 
physical polling between 2008 and 2016 in various states it is worth noting there are 
several outliers.

Huge decreases in the number of physical polling places: Colorado, Washington, Utah, 
Puerto Rico and Iowa.
Colorado and Washington now primarily conduct elections by mail and in the 2016 general 
election 21 counties in Utah participated in a vote by mail. 
As for Iowa, they did not report the the number of physical polling places to the 2016 
EAVS.
I'm not sure about Puerto Rico though and that could be worth investigating in a separate 
analysis.

Several states also saw huge increases: Tennessee, Mississippi and Delaware Illinois.
Tennessee and Illinois didn't report the number of physical polling places in the state
for the 2008 EAVS. 
Delaware just appears to have increased the number of polling places. 
Mississippi may be worth looking into. 

Three states saw no gross increase or decrease: Oregon, Connecticut, and Massachussets

What we know: 

Colorado and Washington are largely irrelevant though fewer physical polling
places could prove problematic to homeless people. 

Most states appear to have seen a decrease in polling places. Not only that there 
was a decrease in the number of polling places per every 10,000 voters decreased as a 
well.

I did the same thing above but with the data from the 2012 and 2016 surveys. 

What we know: 

This echoes the data from 2008 and 2016 comparison most states saw a decrease
