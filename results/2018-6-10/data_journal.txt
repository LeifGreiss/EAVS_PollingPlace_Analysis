Data Journal and Notes:

After doing some basic analysis of the data primarily looking at the percentage change of 
physical polling between 2008 and 2016 in various states it is worth noting there are 
several outliers.

Huge decreases in the number of physical polling places: Colorado, Washington, Utah, 
Puerto Rico and Iowa.
Colorado and Washington now primarily conduct elections by mail and in the 2016 general 
election 21 counties in Utah participated in a vote by mail. 
As for Iowa, they did not report the the number of physical polling places to the 2016 
EAVS.
I'm not sure about Puerto Rico though and that could be worth investigating in a separate 
analysis.

Several states also saw huge increases: Tennessee, Mississippi and Delaware Illinois.
Tennessee and Illinois didn't report the number of physical polling places in the state
for the 2008 EAVS. 
Delaware just appears to have increased the number of polling places. 
Mississippi may be worth looking into. 

Three states saw no gross increase or decrease: Oregon, Connecticut, and Massachussets

What I know: 

Colorado and Washington are largely irrelevant though fewer physical polling
places could prove problematic to homeless people. 

Most states appear to have seen a decrease in polling places. Not only that there 
was a decrease in the number of polling places per every 10,000 voters decreased as a 
well.

I did the same thing above but with the data from the 2012 and 2016 surveys. 

What I know: 

This echoes the data from 2008 and 2016 comparison most states saw a decrease in 
the percentage of polling places and in the number of polling places per every 
10,000 voters decreased.

1:30pm
This time I looked at 2014 and 2016 results where similar once again it generally appeared
that the number of polling places were decreasing.

2:50pm
I looked at the voter participation rates versus the ratio of polling places per person
and there doesn't appear to be a strong correlation between the two variables. At most 
there is is a slight positive one, but it does appear that the majority of jurisdictions 
clump between 25 percent and 75 percent participation and in that area is where the most
variation occurs and the majority of jurisdictions that have high rates of physical 
polling places per 10,000. 

Moving on from here: 
I need to determine if there was any measurable impact in voter participation due to 
decreasing numbers of physical polling places or a failure to create new physical polling 
places. Anecdotal evidence tells us that longer lines do decrease participation. What also
needs to be accounted for is that:

132,609,063 ballots were cast in '08 participation at 61.6 percent
90,912,015 in '10 participation at 41 percent
130,292,355 in '12 participation at 58.2 percent
83,262,122 in '14 participation at 35.9 percent
138,846,571 in '16 participation at 60.1 percent

I will have to find a way to show correlation if possible despite the varying turnouts 
year to year.
